            <p>I am a Software Engineering student at Carleton University. I started my first year in 2015. I take an interest to software, and software design, particularly to security. My hobbies include video games, and making mods or plugins for video games. Below you will see my previous projects, resume, and descriptions of my work experience.</p>

                <p style="padding-top: 24px;">Space Invaders was a school project in which I recreated a popular arcade game using object oriented principles in Java. It features a UI, and difficulty selector. It is the project that I am the most proud of, as it has a very clean
                  design, and clean code.</p>

                <p>I have a hobby of making Minecraft plugins for my <a href="http://yomnetwork.enjin.com/" target="_blank">friend's server</a>.

        				<h4>TwelveDot</h4>
        				<p>While working at TwelveDot Inc. I learned the basics of developing solutions to security problems. I learned how to work in a team to create prototypes, use Arduino for secure communications, and how to read and summarize patents into concise reports. I also developed their Wordpress website at <a href="http://twelvedot.com/" target="_blank">TwelveDot.com</a> Some skills that I learned were Arduino, Front end Web Dev.</p>

        				<h4>Magmic</h4>
        				<p>During my time at Magmic Inc. I gained experience in testing, working in a group, and doing specific tasks laid out by a leader. When given a test plan, and assigned to a task, I was trusted by my manager that I would get the task done quickly, effectively, and independently. Skills that I used were Analytical Thinking, and Debugging.</p>

        				<h4>Minecraft Server</h4>
        				<p>Since 2013 I have been developing plugins for my friend's Minecraft server. Recently, we have started managing a new server ourselves. Some things that I do for it involve updating plugins, testing plugins, and creating custom solutions to the server's needs. Complex Minecraft plugins require extensive knowledge in Java, and Object Oriented Design.</p>
